## Project Motivation

This project aims to predict the user churn, then we can take some measure to reduce the churn rate, thus to get the benefits from this measure.

## Files Description

We use the file (Sparkifyok .ipynb) to finish this project, this file contains the detailed process for load, data exploration, clean,build model and analysis

## Result

According to the results of the model, How long the user registered and whether they add more songs to playlist have the greatest impact. I post a blog about the detail, you can find it https://lijianhua040704.github.io/.
