Project Motivation
	This project aims to predict the user churn, then we can take some measure to reduce the churn rate, thus to get the benefits from this measure.

Files Description
We use the file (Sparkify20200801 .ipynb) to finish this project, this file contains the detailed process for load, data exploration, clean,build model and analysis.  

Result
According to the results of the model, How long the user registered and whether they add more songs to playlist have the greatest impact. I post a blog about the detail, you can find it here.
